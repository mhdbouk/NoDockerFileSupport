# NoDockerFileSupport

In this repository, you will find an example of how to use the new package [Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Build.Containers/) to build and publish a .NET application into a Docker container.

With this tool, you no longer need to manage a separate `Dockerfile` for your application. This means you can save time and focus on building your application.

To try out the example, clone the repository and follow the step-by-step guid in the following blog post [https://mdbouk.com/you-no-longer-need-a-dockerfile/](https://mdbouk.com/you-no-longer-need-a-dockerfile/)
